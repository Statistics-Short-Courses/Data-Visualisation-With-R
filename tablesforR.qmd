title: "Preparing Data for Tables"
editor: visual

Now that we've covered the main types of variables, we can start thinking about how to prepare and visually represent data with figures and tables. In this section, we will focus on preparing data for tables.

In R, datasets are stored as dataframes, which are objects made up of rows and columns. Each row corresponds to an individual observation, while each column represents the variable that is being measured. There are several ways R stores variables: character for text, factor for categorical, integer for whole numbers, numeric for decimals, and logical for booleans (TRUE/FALSE).

Cleaning data can be the most time-consuming, yet arguably the most important, part of analysing data! Generally, it is

-   wide format to long format

To understand R, we will examine these concepts using real-world datasets.

### NAPLAN

The first dataset to be explored is the NAPLAN dataset. NAPLAN stands for the National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy, and is an annual national assessment for all students in year 3, 5, 7, and 9. The assessment is designed to evaluate whether students are building essential literacy and numeracy skills (https://www.nap.edu.au/naplan/faqs/naplan--general).

To load in the dataset, we can use the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
naplan <- read.csv("Data-sets/naplan_reading.csv")
```

Now that we have the dataset loaded in, let's take a look at the variables in the dataset using `str()`.

```{r}
str(naplan)
```

In the top line, we can see that there are 3000 observations and 11 variables.

We can confirm this using the `dim()` function

```{r}
dim(naplan)
```

Using the `names()` function, we can see the variable names.

```{r}
names(naplan)
```

The first column gives us the variables, the second column gives us the type of variable, and the third column gives us individual observations for each row. However, we can see `school_type` is stored as a `chr` or character (text) variable. Text variables are very common when you encounter surveys that have customer feedback, for example, as each response will be unique from one another.

It is important to check that your variables are stored correctly. We can see certain variables like reading time at home is an integer, which matches our expectations.

You can use the `unique()` function to see the unique groupings or labels within a categorical variable. In our case, we can use it to confirm if our suspicions that `school_type` is categorical. To call a specific variable, we call the dataset followed by `$` and then the variable name.

```{r}
unique(naplan$school_type)
```

There are only 3 unique labels, which strongly suggests that `school type` is a nominal categorical variable. If it were truly a text variable, we might see thousands of unique labels.

We can manually convert the variable to categorical using `as.factor()`:

```{r}
naplan$school_type <- as.factor(naplan$school_type)
```

```{r}
str(naplan)
```

Now we can see `school_type` is a factor with 3 levels (or 3 unique labels).

Alternatively, we can also convert all strings (text) to categorical variables with the `stringsAsFactors` argument when we read in the dataset.

```{r}
naplan <- read.csv("Data-sets/naplan_reading.csv",
                   stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

```{r}
str(naplan)
```

As seen above, all the `chr` variables have been converted to `Factor`, which is how the variables should be stored. Note that there might be times where you need a variable stored as `chr`, so you should always be sure of what you're checking.

We can now attach the dataset. Attaching the dataset means we can call variables directly without using `$`. For instance, we can call `school_type` directly as opposed to `naplan$school_type`.

```{r}
attach(naplan)
```

If we type `naplan` directly in, we can see the content.

```{r}
naplan
```

Alternatively, we can use the `View()` function to open up a new tab in RStudio with the dataset.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
View(naplan)
```

We can also select parts of the dataframe. In R, we subset by calling the dataset followed by `[,]` . Writing a blank space before the comma indicates that all rows are includes, while a blank space after the comma indicates that all columns are included. For example, `[,3]` selects the third column of a dataframe. If we want to select the first three columns, we can write:

```{r}
# Select the first three columns of the Naplan dataset
naplan[,1:3]
```

Perhaps we only want to select the middle rows for all the columns of the dataframe.

```{r}
# Select the fifth and sixth row of the Naplan dataset
naplan[5:6,]
```

We can even select rows based on logical tests on the values of one or more variables.

```{r}
# Select all rows (observations) that have a reading time at 
# home greater than 30 mins and a naplan reading score greater than 800
naplan[reading_time_home > 30 & naplan_reading_score > 800,]
```

We can also sort the rows and the columns in the dataset. By default, R will sort in ascending order.

```{r}
# Order the naplan reading score (ascending)
naplan[order(naplan_reading_score),]
```

We can also sort and select odd-numbered columns.

```{r}
# Order the naplan reading score (ascending) 
# and select only odd-numbered columns
naplan[order(naplan_reading_score), c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)]
```

Or descending order.

```{r}
# Order the naplan reading score (descending)
# and select only odd-numbered columns
naplan[rev(order(naplan_reading_score)), c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)]
```

We can summarise the content of the dataframe as well.

```{r}
summary(naplan)
```

You might notice that the summary doesn't quite work for categorical variables.

We can use `tapply()` and `with()` to summarise a quantitative variable by a qualitative variable.

```{r}
with(naplan, tapply(naplan_reading_score, grade, mean))
```

`aggregate()` allows you to summarise by one or more categorical variables, while `tapply` can only summarise one variable at a time.

```{r}
aggregate(naplan[,c(4,11)], list(grade),mean)
```

```{r}
aggregate(naplan[,c(4,11)], list(Grade = grade),mean)
```

```{r}
aggregate(naplan[,c(4,11)], list(Grade = grade, "Parent Education" = parent_education),mean)
```

### Exercise: Palmer Penguins 

![](images/derek-oyen-3Xd5j9-drDA-unsplash (1).jpg){fig-align="center" width="542"}

First, we will need to load in some data into R. We will be working with the `palmerpenguins` package. The `palmerpenguins` package is a dataset collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

If you have not used this package before, you will need to install it first:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

Once installed, you will need to load the package into R.

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

Now that we have the package installed, let's take a look at the variables in the dataset using `str()`.

```{r}
str(penguins)
```

You might notice that some values are listed as `NA`. This means there are missing observations. To check for missing values, we can use:

```{r}
any(is.na(penguins))
```

Since this returns `TRUE`, we know there are missing values in the dataset. Let's find out how many:

```{r}
sum(is.na(penguins))
```

There are 19 missing observations. This can cause problems when generating numerical summaries or running statistical tests. At this stage, to handle this, we can remove the missing values. It's always best practice to store your cleaned data in a new dataset and leave the original untouched. **Note that you should always be careful when removing observations, as even partially filled observations can still provide valuable information.**

```{r}
clean_penguins <- na.omit(penguins)
```

We can check the structure again to make sure everything looks good:

```{r}
str(clean_penguins)
```

We can see that there are eight variables. Three of these are categorical: `species`, `island`, and `sex`. These are stored as factors, where the *levels* represent the number of distinct labels or groups within each variable. For example, `sex` has two levels: `male` and `female`.

You'll notice that there are four numerical variables: `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, and `year`. If your instinct is that `year` doesn't quite fit as right as a numerical variable, you would be right! It is better to treat `year` as a categorical variable. To convert it, we can use:

```{r}
clean_penguins$year <- as.factor(clean_penguins$year)
```

Now if we run `str` again, we can see that `year` is now correctly stored as a categorical variable with three levels.

```{r}
str(clean_penguins)
```

If you're interested in seeing the unique groupings or labels within a categorical variable, you can use the `unique()` function.

```{r}
unique(clean_penguins$year)
```

This shows that the data was collected over the years 2007, 2008, and 2009.

You can also see from the structure output `str()` that the `penguins` dataset is stored as a 333 x 8 tibble, which is a type of data frame in R. This means that there are 333 rows (observations) and 8 columns (variables).

We can confirm this using the `dim()` function.

```{r}
dim(clean_penguins)
```

If you wish to have a closer look at inspecting the `penguins` dataset, you can use the `View()` function to open it in a new tab on RStudio.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(penguins)
View(clean_penguins)
```

Now that we've inspected the dataset, we can start thinking about how to visually represent and understand the data.

As we have learnt

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
